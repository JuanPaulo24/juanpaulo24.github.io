    <h2 id="navigation">Autobiography</h2>
    <p> I am Neyl Lawrence B. Sarita, I was born on November 15,2003 in Butuan Medical Center. We are three in the family. I am the first child. My mother’s name is Cherry Lyen S. Mongaya  and my father’s name is Leo Austin M. Mongaya, and they are from the municipality of Magallanes and also my two siblings Louisiana Christine S. Mongaya and Marc Leonel S. Mongaya. I took my elementary education as well as my secondary education at Tierra Santa Montessori School located at Imus Cavite. I had a happy childhood living with my parents and my siblings. During weekends, we usually spend our day in the park. We helped each other in our daily activities. My family was a happy and a loving family.</p>
    <p>During my high school days, I usually spend my free time in the library together with my friends. Reading has been an important part in my life. I have always loved reading since reading entertains, educates and informs. Reading interesting novels such as fiction books has been part of the entertainment aspect of my reading history. I love the way stories are told in books and as I read, I often get overwhelmed and enter the scene being explained in the story. At times I feel I am watching live scenes, this entertained me. I am currently studying at ACLC, first year BSIT college student. I have put a lot of effort into establishing the greatest future I can for myself because I am highly motivated to do so. </p>
    <p>Being devoted, self-driven, and a dreamer are some of my strengths. My shortcomings include my tendency to be overly ambitious, take on too much at once, and have high expectations for others. Good days gave me happiness, bad days gave me experiences, which are both essential to life. Success keeps me growing and failures make me humble. </p>
